				<Paragraph>
					This demo uses Figmagic with design tokens, and elements that are output into React and
          Styled Components.
        </Paragraph>
				<Paragraph>
					As a front end developer using Figmagic, your work should ideally focus on composing any
          larger compositions and handling any state that the application needs. For this form
          example, that's precisely the additional work that was needed to tie the
          Figmagic-generated elements into this small app. Figmagic should be able to handle most of
          the boilerplate and detail setup, sparing you from the most boring work.
        </Paragraph>
				<Paragraph>
					<strong>Pro tip</strong>: Make changes in your Figmagic template document (in Figma, that
          is!). Open a separate terminal and run Figmagic while you are still running this demo web
          server. The web server should reload automatically when it detects that it has new files.
          SUPER-HOT!
